[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/12aa2b03-e92c-4c42-a5fd-038f8d1dae58/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/grant-avery-com/deploys)

You can view this site at [grantavery.com](https://www.grantavery.com/). It uses [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (which is built on top of React) to bundle the pages and content (some of which is pulled from my [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) CMS), and then on push to GitHub, [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) publishes it to update the live site.

## Local Dev

### Gatsby setup

```sh
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

### Change directories into site folder

```sh
cd grant-avery-com/
```

### Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Get the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) `.env` config file from a fellow developer

The file should include the keys for Contentful's CMS API and Google's Recaptcha.

Example:

```txt
GATSBY_SITE_RECAPTCHA_KEY=ENTER_YOUR_KEY_HERE
GATSBY_CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=ENTER_YOUR_ID_HERE
GATSBY_CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_TOKEN=ENTER_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
GATSBY_PI_API_URL=ENTER_YOUR_URL_HERE
```

### Start development server

```sh
gatsby develop
```

Available at: `http://localhost:8000`!

*Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).*

### Create a production build

```sh
gatsby build
```

### Serve the production build locally

```sh
gatsby serve
```

## Pi Page

Accessible at {baseUrl}/pi

Uses [my Pi API repo](https://github.com/grantavery/pi-api) as a NodeJS Express API to retrieve Pi values from Google's more cumbersome [Pi API](https://pi.delivery/).

## Gatsby Info (taken from their starter project README)

### Create a new site

```sh
gatsby new grant-avery-com
```

### Different files

- **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

- **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins youâ€™d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

- **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

- **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

### Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the *Guides*, *API Reference*, and *Advanced Tutorials* sections in the sidebar.
